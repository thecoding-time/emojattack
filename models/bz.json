A static standstill.\n\nThen, in 1951, a Soviet biophysicist found a set of chemicals that cycled *indefinitely!* In fact, if you put the chemicals in a Petri dish, it'll create beautiful spirals like the one in this simulation.\n\nThus, the scientific community immediately hailed his discovery, and‚Äì\n\nHaha no.
